                <h2>The Discovery of Coffee</h2>

                <p>There is a legend that describes an Ethiopian monk who first discovered coffee somewhere around the 9th century (years 800-899). 
                    When herding animals, he noticed that they would become energetic when eating the berries containing coffee (yes, coffee is a berry. 
                    It's the bean inside the berry that we all know and love). 
                    This monk's name was Kaldi, who reported this finding to his abbot (the head monk). 
                    The abbot made a drink from these beans, and to his wonder, he found that it made him energetic and awake enough to endure the long hours of his prayers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, monks willingly isolate themselves from the rest of society. 
                    Therefore, even if this legend is true, the monks would not have 
                    communicated this to the rest of human civilization. 
                    It was not until hundreds of years later that coffee&mdash;as a drink&mdash; would be discovered again. 
                </p>

                <h2>The (Re)Discovery of Coffee</h2>
                <p>The power of coffee was rediscovered again around the middle of the 15th century in the country of Yemen. 
                    Somehow, the Ethiopian coffee bean was introduced to the locals of the country. 
                    They too thought to create a drink from these beans, and through its effects, they realized a serious financial opportunity.</p>
                    

                <h2>Popularity in Arabia</h2>
                    <p>Yemeni famers began mass-producing these beans on their farms&mdash;marking the beginning of the first recorded coffee industry in human history! 
                    The beans produced from these farms held great value, and thus made those in the business of coffee very wealthy.
                    They made their way north of the peninsula through what is now modern-day Saudi Arabia, and by the start of the 16th century, coffee became known all over the Arabian peninsula. 
                    </p>
                
                <h2>Popularity in Europe & The Americas</h2>
                <p>Trade being trade, word about something like coffee would get around eventually to other major nations in the world.
                    In Europe, the coffee bean was introduced by the start of the 17th century and soon became a staple of the European diet.
                    In fact, they loved it so much, they introduced it to the American colonies across the Atlanic ocean!
                </p>

                <h2>Yemen's Coffee Industry: A King Dethroned</h2>
                
                <p>
                    For centuries, Yemen was the leading grower and exporter of coffee, which made up nearly all of the country's income.
                    It was a significant in the global trade market at the time. 
                    However, it would soon be challenged as major nations in Europe began a conquest of imperialism, taking over other nations as colonies.
                    Britain, France, and the Netherlands ran what is commonly referred to as an "East India Company".
                    These companies got a hold of raw coffee supply, and began forcing the nations they took over to mass produce them as well.
                    The coffee beans these colonies produced would be sold by the East India Company operating under the control of the mother nation.
                    At this point, these more powerful nations began undercutting their prices below the Yemeni cost, and the less powerful Yemeni coffee industry
                    could not compete for long. About two centuries after the first East India Company was esatablished (c. 1600 to 1800), Yemen only had a 6% market 
                    share in the coffee industry&mdash;that number dropping to 0.1% today.
                </p>


                <h2>Coffee is Gold</h2>

                <p>Coffee is the gold of beverages. It ranks #1 as the most in-demand agricultural commodity in the world, and has been for a long time.
                    It is no wonder other nations have decided to take part in this coffee market. 
                    Today, Brazil is now the largest exporter of coffee in the world. It started its coffee industry in the late 18th century, and rapidly growed to be 
                    a major player by the early 19th century. No matter who produces coffee, one thing is certain: it will always be the golden plant.
