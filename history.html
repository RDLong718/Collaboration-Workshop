                <h2>The Discovery of Coffee</h2>

                <p>There is a legend that describes an Ethiopian monk who first discovered coffee. When herding animals, he noticed that 
                    they would become energetic when eating the berries containing coffee (yes, coffee is a berry. It's the bean inside the 
                    berry that we all know and love). This monk's name was Kaldi, who reported this finding to his abbot (the head monk). 
                    The abbot made a drink from these beans, and to his wonder, he found that it made him energetic and awake enough to endure 
                    the long hours of his prayers.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Soon, knowledge of this discovery began to spread. Farmers and merchants across the Arabian peninsula began growing and selling 
                    these magic beans as their popularity soard. A drink that can delay fatigue and tiredness? Who wouldn't want a taste of 
                    that! 
                </p>
